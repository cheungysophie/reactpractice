        content: 'A lot of deeply pessimistic worldview comes from a straight line linear extrapolation of negative trends whilst ignoring positive trends. Positive trends come from creativity and knowledge creation. It’s inherently unpredictable. Every generation has its doomsayer - they’re popular the same way zombie and vampire movies are. But the reality is they cannot predict what we’ll do in the future that will improve our quality of life.'

        content: 'The earth is finite, we will all die if we don’t preserve resources. But how did you decide it’s the earth? why not your town? solar system? galaxy? universe? A resource is something that through knowledge it can convert from one thing to another. There was a time when coal was not a resource, when iron was not a resource. To a caveman, very few things are resources. Finite resource model of the world implicitly assumes finite knowledge - knowledge creation has come to an end, we are stuck at this current point, therefore based on our current knowledge these are all our current resources. But knowledge is something that we can always create more of. '
